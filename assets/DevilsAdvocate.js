//Devil's Advocate - You know what it's like when an excess of anything puts you off that thing completely? Well, that's how a possible cupid turned into the devil's advocate. 
//On Valentine's week, 2017, as I was walking back home after getting supplies from the supermarket, I realized tons of shops that were strewn with anything that was soft, cuddly, red or in any way, symbolic of love. I probably even smiled at the sight of the first two-three shops that came along. Slowly, but definitely, the sight of these overt displays begging people to profess their love started to annoy me.
//I should make clear now that i am not a hater of this tradition, the idea of celebrating love, or anything on those lines.
//But on seeing all these shops, somehow, i wanted to "celebrate" Valentine's week a different way - possibly the devil's way.
//Here are a few illustrations meant for each one of the days of the Valentine's week.

//Rose Day: Pride: from the grave
//Propose Day: Greed: When you have no idea you're engaged to the devil himself. 
//Chocolate Day: Gluttony: When chocolate is all that you are made up of. And all that you can bleed.
//Teddy Day: Wrath: When you're not particularly keen on teddy bears.
//Promise Day: Sloth: When the reaper promises to come back for you!
//Hug Day: Envy: When all you represent is a satanic symbol
//Kiss Day: Lust: The kiss of death.

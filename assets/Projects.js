//Devil's Advocate - You know what it's like when an excess of anything puts you off that thing completely? Well, that's how a possible cupid turned into the devil's advocate. 
//On Valentine's week, 2017, as I was walking back home after getting supplies from the supermarket, I realized tons of shops that were strewn with anything that was soft, cuddly, red or in any way, symbolic of love. I probably even smiled at the sight of the first two-three shops that came along. Slowly, but definitely, the sight of these overt displays begging people to profess their love started to annoy me.
//I should make clear now that i am not a hater of this tradition, the idea of celebrating love, or anything on those lines.
//But on seeing all these shops, somehow, i wanted to "celebrate" Valentine's week a different way - possibly the devil's way.
//Here are a few illustrations meant for each one of the days of the Valentine's week.
//Rose Day: Pride: from the grave
//Propose Day: Greed: When you have no idea you're engaged to the devil himself. 
//Chocolate Day: Gluttony: When chocolate is all that you are made up of. And all that you can bleed.
//Teddy Day: Wrath: When you're not particularly keen on teddy bears.
//Promise Day: Sloth: When the reaper promises to come back for you!
//Hug Day: Envy: When all you represent is a satanic symbol
//Kiss Day: Lust: The kiss of death.


//Music and lyrics - "Hello, hello hello... Is there anybody in there?"
//Most weekday mornings were the same. Staying a good 15 kms away from my place of work, I spent a lot of time travelling to and from my workplace. I tried to use this time productively - read a book / listen to a podcast but either motion sickness or drowsiness kicked in, keeping me from the good these had to offer. I then started to listen to music while on the road.
//It was a similar sleepy morning and my usual shuffle playlist, when my mind went on to wander, dreamily.
//"Hello, hello hello... Is there anybody in there?"
//The reverberation of the hello made me imagine how it was being received by my sensory organs. Being a lover of Biology, I knew my subject relatively well. I could imagine the word travel from my outer ear, through the ear canal, causing vibrations in the eardrum that were finally being amplified and sent to the cochlea - the snail shaped structure filled with fluid.
//And suddenly, there it was. Stories and images being built and shattered, over and over again, with the harmonic cadence. I mentally took notes of the images and the stories to create them once I was home
//I don't know what i was more fascinated about- the music, the science, or the way i imagined it to happen.
//Like any other piece of art, this was far from accurate - it was a representation of a thought, of a feeling that I got while listening to the song.

        <p>On Valentine's week, 2017, as I was walking back home after getting supplies from the supermarket, I realized tons of shops that were strewn with anything that was soft, cuddly, red or in any way, symbolic of love. I probably even smiled at the sight of the first two-three shops that came along. Slowly, but definitely, the sight of these overt displays begging people to profess their love started to annoy me.</p>
        <p>I should make clear now that i am not a hater of this tradition, the idea of celebrating love, or anything on those lines.</p>
        <p>But on seeing all these shops, somehow, i wanted to "celebrate" Valentine's week a different way - possibly the devil's way.</p>
        <p>Here are a few illustrations meant for each one of the days of the Valentine's week.</p>`,

      longDescription: `<p>Most weekday mornings were the same for me. Staying a good 15 Km away from my place of work, I spent a lot of time traveling to and from my workplace. I tried to use this time productively, by reading books or listen to podcasts, but either motion sickness or drowsiness kicked in, keeping me from the good these had to offer. I then started to listen to music while on the road.</p>
        <p>It was a similar sleepy morning and my usual shuffle playlist, when my mind went on to wander, dreamily.</p>
        <p>"Hello, hello hello... Is there anybody in there?"</p>
        <p>The reverberation of the hello made me imagine how it was being received by my sensory organs. Being a lover of Biology, I knew my subject relatively well. I could imagine the word travel from my outer ear, through the ear canal, causing vibrations in the eardrum that were finally being amplified and sent to the cochlea - the snail shaped structure filled with fluid.</p>
        <p>And suddenly, there it was. Stories and images being built and shattered, over and over again, with the harmonic cadence. I mentally took notes of the images and the stories to create them once I was home.</p>
        <p>I don't know what i was more fascinated about- the music, the science, or the way i imagined it to happen.</p>
        <p>Like any other piece of art, this was far from accurate - it was a representation of a thought, of a feeling that I got while listening to the song.</p>`,

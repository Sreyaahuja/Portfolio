//Music and lyrics - "Hello, hello hello... Is there anybody in there?"
//Most weekday mornings were the same. Staying a good 15 kms away from my place of work, I spent a lot of time travelling to and from my workplace. I tried to use this time productively - read a book / listen to a podcast but either motion sickness or drowsiness kicked in, keeping me from the good these had to offer. I then started to listen to music while on the road.
//It was a similar sleepy morning and my usual shuffle playlist, when my mind went on to wander, dreamily.
//"Hello, hello hello... Is there anybody in there?"
//The reverberation of the hello made me imagine how it was being received by my sensory organs. Being a lover of Biology, I knew my subject relatively well. I could imagine the word travel from my outer ear, through the ear canal, causing vibrations in the eardrum that were finally being amplified and sent to the cochlea - the snail shaped structure filled with fluid.
//And suddenly, there it was. Stories and images being built and shattered, over and over again, with the harmonic cadence. I mentally took notes of the images and the stories to create them once I was home
//I don't know what i was more fascinated about- the music, the science, or the way i imagined it to happen.
//Like any other piece of art, this was far from accurate - it was a representation of a thought, of a feeling that I got while listening to the song.
